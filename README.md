# LICENTA
Bachelor's degree final project

This project is about a medical clinic and management system.
I used the following technologies: -HTML
                                   -CSS
                                   -JavaScript
                                   -FIREBASE

As a client you can make appointments, view profile of doctors and clinic.
As a doctor you need to login/register to the website in order to add appointments, see a tabel with all appointments and manage your profile.

All information is displayed dinamically from the database.

Latest update: - fixed a bug where client code wouldnt match with database code
- fixed some form control messages
- added delete option for clients with their appointments
